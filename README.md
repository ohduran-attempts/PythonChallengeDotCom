# PythonChallengeDotCom
All my proposed solutions for www.pythonchallenge.com

### Note: 
I have avoided linking each solution to its correspondent page, so that googling the solution won't redirect to this repository, and keep it fun for those who haven't sorted it out yet. Feel free to suggest performance improvement (there must be tons of way to improve this code, as I was doing it rapidly and with no regards to performance or code quality/readability). Find each challenge stored as PC**, where ** is the number of the challenge.

### WARNING: 
Spoilers. Look only if you have sorted it out already. I am not responsible for your whining if you keep reading :).

### Side note: All this solutions were coded in 
- IDE:
PyCharm Cmmunity Edition 2017.1.2
- Python version: 2.7.12
